# mothulity - web interface

Web Interface and database/job scheduler for [mothulity](https://github.com/dizak/mothulity).

The main principle is to:
1. Present HTML front-end to the user which gathers submission data.
2. Run a separate sched.py script which takes care of reading what was gathered in the database, submits it to [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) and watches the submitted process.

django-mothulity stores its settings in the database - there is no need for any modification in the code (including the paths, scheduler and HPC settings) once it is deployed. The settings are bound to the domain name other than ```localhost``` and specified in ```<name_of_project>/settings.py ALLOWED_HOSTS```. Once this is specified, these settings must specified in the Admin Panel. This solution does NOT allow for using more than domain name - the settings will always bound to first object from the ```ALLOWED_HOSTS``` other than ```localhost```.

### Installation for Production - NGINX and Gunicorn (virtual environment is advised, as always)

These instructions are compliant to [this tutorial at DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-18-04) but with the standard SQL database. Neverthless, is should work with any database backend.

1. Setup the production NGINX server and the Gunicorn WSGI as indicated in the [DigitalOcean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-18-04). Working in the virtual environment, created during the server setup, follow the instructions below.

1. ```pip install django-mothulity-*.tar.gz``` - the project will most probably NOT be distributed with the PyPI.

1. Add ```'django.contrib.sites',``` and ```'mothulity',``` to ```<name_of_project>/settings.py INSTALLED_APPS```.

1. It is assumed that ```'localhost'``` and ```'<your.domain.com>'``` are in the ```<name_of_project>/settings.py ALLOWED_HOSTS``` already. If not - add it.

1. ```python manage.py test mothulity```. - check if everything is all right.

1. ```python manage.py createsuperuser``` - create the Admin user and the Admin Panel.

1. ```python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate``` - setup the database.

1. In the Admin Panel:

  - Add <your.domain.com> to Sites.

  - Add Path settings and Hpc settings. The default ones should be OK.

Updates of the ```django-mothulity``` app should require nothing more than ```pip install --upgrade django-mothulity-*.tar.gz```.

### Installation for Development


1. Clone ```dizak/django-mothulity```

1. Run ```pip install -r django-mothulity/requirements.txt```, virtual environment recommended.

1. Type ```django-admin startproject <name_of_project> django-mothulity``` - this will create a Django project **WITHIN** the the cloned repo. This is intended.

1. Add ```'django.contrib.sites',``` and ```mothulity.apps.MothulityConfig``` to ```<name_of_project>/<name_of_project>/settings.py INSTALLED_APPS``` list.

1. Add ```'localhost'``` and ```'<your.domain.com>'``` to ```<name_of_project>/settings.py ALLOWED_HOSTS``` - it is needed for the Path Settings and HPC Settings which are bound to the Site's domain and name. Path Settings and HPC Settings work with only one domain name, other that localhost and are independent of the Site's ID. There is no need for adding the ```SITE_ID``` variable to the ```<name_of_project>/<name_of_project>/settings.py```. See [this documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/pl/2.1/ref/contrib/sites/) for more details about the Django's Site framework.

1. Add ```from django.conf.urls import include, url``` to ```<name_of_project>/<name_of_project>/urls.py```.

1. Add ```url(r"^mothulity/", include("mothulity.urls"))``` to ```<name_of_project>/<name_of_project>/urls.py```.

1. Run ```python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate```.

1. Run ```python manage.py test```.

1. In the Admin Panel:

  - Add <your.domain.com> to Sites.

  - Add Path settings and Hpc settings. The default ones should be OK.

1. Run ```python manage.py runserver```.

  - This starts the development HTTP server.

1. Run ```python sched.py <name_of_project>```

  - This starts the scheduler.

### Requirements

- SSH keys exchanged with the computing cluster.

- The same directory mounted at the Web-Server and the HPC. Paths set-up with the ```PathSettings``` available at the Admin Panel.
